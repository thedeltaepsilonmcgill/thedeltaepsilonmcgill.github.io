    <p>After a 10 year hiatus, we are very excited to announce the return of The Delta Epsilon! We are an undergraduate math journal, by undergrads for undergrads, for anyone with a passion for mathematics, regardless of their major or program. Our articles are reviewed by graduate students in mathematics. This is a great opportunity for undergrads to gain experience writing a paper for publication and showcase work they are proud of! As a bonus, it looks great on CVs and grad school apps. Right now we are looking for submissions for our April 2025 issue. The deadline to submit will be Feb. 7th, 2025 at 11:59pm. If you are interested in submitting, please check out our <a href="./pdfs/submissionGuidelines.pdf">submission guidelines</a>. </p>
