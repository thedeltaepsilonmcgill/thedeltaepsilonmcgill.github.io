    <p>After a 10 year hiatus, we are very excited to announce the return of The Delta Epsilon! We are an undergraduate math journal, by undergrads for undergrads, for anyone with a passion for mathematics, regardless of their major or program. Our articles are reviewed by graduate students in mathematics. This is a great opportunity for undergrads to gain experience writing a paper for publication and showcase work they are proud of! As a bonus, it looks great on CVs and grad school apps. </p>
